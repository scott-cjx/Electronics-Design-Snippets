# Connectors

The foundation of Input/ Outputs.


### Considerations

Some considerations to take when choosing the right connector for your IO

- number of pins
- power (current & voltage) rating for EACH pin
- form factor
- gender
- purpose
- the user

> So, if the intended purpose of a output port is for USB (for example), we should use a USB Connector as it is obvious (hopefully) to the user what set of wires can be used to connect to the port and in what manner (UI/UX consideration). Granted, there will be exceptions to this too (more later).
