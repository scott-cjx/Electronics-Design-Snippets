# Kicad Snippets

During my years of tinkering and circuit design, I found myself repeatedly redoing the same schematics over and over again. Thus this repository serves as my collection of commonly used circuitry that I would refer to when i have to use them again.

## Basics

Depending on the purpose of the circuit board, there will be many different design choice and rules that one will have to follow.

## Components of a Circuit Board

- Inputs and Outputs (IOs)
- Logic & Control
- Power

### Inputs and Outputs (IOs)

These are components that will serve as a connection between a board and another board, or a board with another physical entity
